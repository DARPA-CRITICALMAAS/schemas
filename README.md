## Schemas and APIs
A place to describe schemas for data and APIs for services for the project.

We propose to use [JSON Schemas](http://json-schema.org/specification.html) to describe data - specifically the [2020-12 version](http://json-schema.org/specification-links.html#2020-12).

The benfits of this approach are because the JSON format:
- Describes your existing data format(s).
- Provides clear human- and machine- readable documentation.
- Validates data which is useful for:
- Automated testing.
- Ensures quality of client submitted data.

There is a great guide for JSON Schemas [here](http://json-schema.org/learn/getting-started-step-by-step.html).
